Artificial Intelligence  best shortly known as (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in the field of education, fundamentally reshaping the roles and responsibilities of teachers. In traditional classrooms, educators have long shouldered a broad range of tasks—from lesson planning and grading to classroom management and individualized student support. These responsibilities can be time-consuming, leaving little room for innovation or personalized attention. AI, through the use of machine learning algorithms, data analysis, and automation, has offered some solutions by augmenting teachers’ capabilities and providing smart tools that streamline routine tasks. Whether it’s grading assignments in seconds, tailoring lesson content to suit individual student needs, or identifying learning gaps in real time, AI enables educators to become more efficient, effective, and responsive. Yet, despite these clear advantages, the integration of AI also brings with it a set of challenges, including concerns about data privacy, algorithmic bias, and a lack of adequate training for educators. This paper explores both the immense potential and the current limitations of AI in teaching, with a focus on real-world applications and future improvements.
